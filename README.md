# myLittleProject
# This was my project for a final exam i had last year
# It's a two program project 
# I wanted to make a copy of a program i had while working as a barista
# The first one is for managing raw materials you use in a coffee shop, and for managing the products you have. You can add new raw materials, you can add or decrease the amount, or delete existing ones.
# For the products you can add or delete them or  you can change their price 
# All of this information is stored in MySQL database that the program accesses
# The second one is for working your coffee shop
# There are tables that are supposed to be put to look like the layaout of your shop
# When you access the table you can order or see the existing products that have already been ordered, you can see the their price, the amount and the total price of all of the products currently ordered on that table
# That is pretty much it, it is really primitive, not the best looking but i did the best i could with the time i had and considering it was my first project i think it's pretty good
